You mean the world to me, in ways words can never fully explain. I could spend a lifetime trying to show you how much you matter to me, and it still wouldn’t be enough. You are the warmth in my cold days, the calm in my chaos, and the one person my heart beats for, over and over again. No matter what happens, no matter where life takes us, my love for you will never change. I will wait for you, for as long as it takes, because loving you isn’t a choice cuz it’s a part of me. You don’t have to love me back, you don’t have to feel the same way, but I will always be here, loving you with everything I have. Because you, Abeer, are the only one my heart wants, the only name my soul whispers, and the only forever I’ll ever need.</p>
